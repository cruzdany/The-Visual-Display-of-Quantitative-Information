    "# The visual display of quantitative information by Edward Rolf Tufte\n",
    "## Chapter 1: Graphical Excellence\n",
    "### 1. What does excellence in statistical consist of? It consist in communicating\n",
    "It consist on complex ideas with clarity, precision and e\u000eciency.\n",
    "### 2. How are usually descriped the data maps in cartography? They are described\n",
    "As thematic maps.\n",
    "### 3. According to the book, in which year was plotted the first economic timeseries?\n",
    "It was not until 1786. He made a map to chart patterns of diseases.\n",
    "### 4. How were marked the dots and water pumps?\n",
    "Deaths were marked by dots and area's eleven water pumps were located by crosses.\n",
    "### 5. What is the most frequently plot used from graphic design? \n",
    "The timeseries plot\n",
    "### 6. What are the two great inventors of modern graphical design? They are\n",
    "J. H. Lambert (1728-1777), a Swiss-German scientist and mathematician,\n",
    "and William Playfair (1759-1823), a Scottish political economist.\n",
    "### 7. What does the Minard's map portrays of? It portrays a sequence of\n",
    "Devastating losses suffered in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.\n",
    "### 8. What does the circle, line on the left, line on the right of the playfair piechart represent of? \n",
    "The circle represents the area o f each country; the line on the left, the population in millions read on the vertical scales; the line on the right, the revenue (taxes) collected in millions of pounds sterling read also on the vertical scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 2: Graphical Integrity\n",
    "### 1. What was the assumption that the deceptive graphics had of? \n",
    "They were\n",
    "perceived that they were mainly devices for showing the obvious to the\n",
    "ignorant.\n",
    "### 2. Mention the way in which we can know that visual image represents the underlying numbers. \n",
    "It can be achieved by having people look at lines of varying length, circles of di\u000b",
    "erent areas, and then recording their assessments of the numerical quantities.\n",
    "### 3. What does it the lie factor be equal to one might mean? \n",
    "It might mean that the graphic might be doing a reasonable job of accurately representing the underlying numbers.\n",
    "###  4. What is the formula of the lie factor? \n",
    "Life factor is equal to the size of effect shown in graphic over the size of effect in data. In other words: lie factor = size of effect shown in graphic/size of effect in data.\n",
    "### 5. What are the six principles that make a graphical integrity more likely to result?\n",
    "- The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.\n",
    "- Show data variation, not design variation.\n",
    "- In time-series displays of money, deated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.\n",
    "- The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number o f dimensions in the data.\n",
    "- Graphics must not quote data out of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 3: Sources of graphical integrity and sophistication\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1: How can we achieve graphical sophistication?\n",
    "By using relational graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: What are the primary causes of inept graphical work?\n",
    "Lack of quantitative skills of professional artists, people think that statistical data are boring, and people think that graphics are only for the unsophisticated reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Mention the three skills that graphical competence demand\n",
    "- Substantive skills.\n",
    "- Statistical skills.\n",
    "- Artistic skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: What are the conditions under which many data graphics are produced?\n",
    "- Lack of  substantive and quantitative skills of  the illustrators\n",
    "- Dislike of quantitative evidence, and contempt for the intelligence of the audience\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 4: Data-Ink and Graphical Redesign\n",
    "### 1: What are the two erasing principles?\n",
    "Erase non-data-ink, and erase redundant data-ink, within reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: Mention  the fundamental principle of good statistical graphics.\n",
    "Above all else show the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Mention the formula of Data-ink ratio.\n",
    "Data-ink ratio = data-ink/total ink used to print the graphic\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Mention the uses of redundancy.\n",
    "- Giving a context and order to complexity.\n",
    "- Facilitating comparisons over various parts of the data.\n",
    "- Creating an aesthetic balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 5: Chartjunk: Vibrations, Grids, and Ducks\n",
    "### 1: Mention the three types of chartjunk\n",
    "- Unintentional optical art.\n",
    "- The dreaded grid.\n",
    "- The self-promoting graphical duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: Mention some of the purposes of decoration\n",
    "- To make the graphic appear more scientific and precise.\n",
    "- To enliven the display.\n",
    "- To give the designer an opportunity to exercise artistic skills. \n",

    "- No frame.\n",
    "- No vertical axis.\n",
    "- No ticks, and the white grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: When can we say that the designs are better?\n",
    "They are necessarily better within the principles of the theory, for more information per unit o f space and per unit of ink is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3: Why does the the baseline can be erased in the bar plot?\n",
    "It can be erased since the bars define the end-point at the bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: What does the range-frame show off?\n",
    "It displays the  maximum and minimum o f both variables plotted (along with the range)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 7: Multifunctioning Graphical Elements\n",
    "### 1: What are the three viewing depths in which graphics can be designed.\n",
    "- What is seen from a distance, an overall structure usually aggregated from an underlying microstructure.\n",
    "- What is seen up close and in detail, the fine structure of the data.\n",
    "- What is seen implicitly, underlying the graphic—that which is behind the graphic.\n",

    "Data density of a graphic = (number of entries in data matrix)/(area of data graphic)\n",
    "### 2: What suggestions does the book give if graphics become overcrowded? \n",
    "It might be useful to use a variety of data-reduction techniques—averaging, clustering, smoothing—can thin the num­bers out before plotting\n",
    "### 3: Let's say that your graphic has low density, therefore, you want to increase it, but you do not want to enlarge the data matrix, what thing is recommended to do for in this case? \n",
    "By reducing the area of the graphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Why data-rich designs are important?\n",
